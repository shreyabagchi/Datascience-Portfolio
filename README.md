# My Data Science journey

This portfolio is a compilation of all my work as a data science student and enthusiast. I have worked in a couple of externship and some academic projects as part of my master's degree program. I am pursuing a Masters in Business and Science degree from Rutgers University, specializing in Data Science. During this tenure I have worked in Python, R, PySpark and Tableau.I have worked in projects related to data analysis, cleaning, feature engineering and model building. 
In addition to this, I also have 10+ years of experience in the field of application design and development in Java/J2EE and other web-related technologies.

**Data Science Portfolio of Shreya Bagchi**

This portfolio is a compilation of all my work as a data science student and enthusiast. I have worked in a couple of externship projects and some academic projects as part of my master's degree curriculum. I am a student at Rutgers University pursuing a Masters in Busince and Science degree, specializing in Data Science. During the tenure I have worked in Python, R, PySpark and Tableau.I have worked in projects related to data analysis, cleaning, feature engineering and model building.


**Data Science Projects**

1. **Market Research Analysis using NLP and Sentiment Analysis**
   This project aimed at market research of the varous healthcare products of a company and its competitors. Customer reviews and ratings related to these products were scraped from the different social-media platforms including Twitter, Instagram, Glassdoor etc using Tweepy or BeautifulSoup API. Then the data was cleaned, stopwords were removed, stemming, bag-of-words  created and finally sentiment analysis was done using nltk library.

2. **Sales Prediction using Multiple Regression Analysis**
    This project aimed at building a MLR model for predicting the sales of a retail outlet store. We aimed at cleaning the data, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, outlier detection and removal and finally building a MLR model. Feature selection methods were used like Pearson's correlation coefficient or Forward selection, Backward Elimination and Recursive methods.

3. **Church and Dwight Late Shipment Order Data Analysis**
    This project aimed at analysing the customer-shipment data of Church and Dwight and see if any trend or seasonality exists in the late orders. Also, the project wanted us to analyse the factors that were responsible for the later order shipment.

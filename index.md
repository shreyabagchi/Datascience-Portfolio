This portfolio is a compilation of all my work as a data science student. I have worked in a couple of company-based projects as part of externship and some academic projects as part of my master's degree curriculum. I am a student at Rutgers University pursuing a Masters in Busince and Science degree, specializing in Data Science. During my tenure I have worked both in Python and R.I have worked in projects related to data analysis, cleaning, feature engineering and model building. Prior to this, I have 10+ yrs of experience in application development and design in Java/J2EE. I am currently working as a Teaching Assistant at Rutgers for the Fundamental of Analytics course.

**Data Science Projects**

1. **Market Research Analysis using NLP and Sentiment Analysis**
   This project aimed at market research of the varous healthcare products of a company and its competitors. Customer reviews and ratings related to these products were scraped from the different social-media platforms including Twitter, Instagram, Glassdoor etc using Tweepy or BeautifulSoup API. Then the data was cleaned, stopwords were removed, stemming, bag-of-words  created and finally sentiment analysis was done using nltk library.

2. **Sales Prediction using Multiple Regression Analysis**
    This project aimed at building a MLR model for predicting the sales of a retail outlet store. We aimed at cleaning the data, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, outlier detection and removal and finally building a MLR model. Feature selection methods were used like Pearson's correlation coefficient or Forward selection, Backward Elimination and Recursive methods.
